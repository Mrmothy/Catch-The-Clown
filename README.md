## Known Issues

### > I am aware of an issue where if you end up clicking the clown to close to the bottom of the screen to
### fast it will end up trapping the clown out of the game window and will require the player to quit. 

### > As of right now I have not worked on a fix for this issue and if you have any suggestions please 
### fork and put in a pull request so I can get the code updated. Thank you and enjoy

### About the game making experience:

This was a project I put together to gain some of the fundamentals of how Pygame mechanics work using
with Python. I wanted to learn some basic fundamentals about adding player and object movement. 
This also taught me about loading music and images to my game along with a more in-depth knowledge 
about how a game loop works. This was a blast to make and an awesome learning opportunity for me to 
get a better understanding of how Pygame mechanics works and game design and lay is approached. In 
future projects I want to learn charter animation and more collision detection methods.

### Image, Music and Design Shout-outs:

The game loop design was used from a UDEMY corse lead by Michael Eramo. This gme design is based
off a game he created call Feed The Dragon and can be found in his corse call:
The Art of Doing: Video Game Creation With Python and Pygame
